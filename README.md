Carry Report and Target Report to measure the opportunity NFL players are given.

The carry report shows the number of rushes along the x-axis and the number of targets for those rushers across the y-axis. I filter the number of carries to display a reasonable number of players in the visual. The size of each point on the graph represents the % of rushes that player has for their team.

The target report shows the number of targets along the x-axis and the % of all targets that player has for their team. I filter the number of targets and target share to display a reasonable number of players in the visual. The size of each point on the graph is equal to the number of catches that player has.
